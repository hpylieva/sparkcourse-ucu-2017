# Advanced Programming - UCU- Final Project 

Spark 2.0.2 is used.   
Data is read in RDD and then placed in a Dataset (only those columns which are present in property file).  

There are 2 possible run modes: DEV and PROD. This can be specified in line 16 of Main.java.  
Currently DEV is set.  
The difference is that in DEV mode more printing is used (through aspect).  

Test for PlayerExistValidator is implemented.
